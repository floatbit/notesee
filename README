Drupal 7 module.  

What does it do and how is this useful?

Lets users put notes on pages.  You can use it for reviewing - e.g. let a user browse around a site, posting notes on pages that need fixing or adjusting.

Instructions:

1) Download and install into your modules folder
2) Enable
3) Give a user role the permission to edit notesee items

Once your user logs in there is a fixed menu at the bottom. It can be moved by dragging the blue bar. 

Add a new note:

1) Click +note in the menu.
2) A new note will appear on screen - fill it in then click Save
3) Existing notes can be deleted

Notes can be:
-Moved
-Edited
-Shown/Hidden
-Locked

An advice in these areas welcome: 
+ a better way to detect if the overlay is open so hook_init won't trigger
+ a list of all administration pages besides /admin OR if the current page is an admin page
